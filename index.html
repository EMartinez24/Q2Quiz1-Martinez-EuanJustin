    <h1>Foods from Luzon</h1>

    <p>The rich flavors of Luzon's cuisine, which have been influenced by Spanish, Chinese, and American cuisine as well as indigenous customs, are widely recognized. Luzon cuisine, which is renowned for blending sour, savory, and sweet flavors, frequently combines a range of meats, fish, and vegetables with seasonings like coconut milk, vinegar, and soy sauce. Signature dishes include pancit habhab (stir-fried noodles served on banana leaves), Vigan longganisa (Ilocos sausages infused with garlic), laing (taro leaves cooked in coconut milk and chili), and pinakbet (a vegetable medley with bitter melon, squash, and shrimp paste). These recipes highlight Luzon's focus on regional ingredients and bright tastes.</p>
